# Detect Mouse After Hotkey

This is a simple script that allows you to detect when your mouse button is pressed and execute an action if the hotkey (Ctrl + Shift + 12) was already toggled. If you press the hotkey again it will de-activate, and the action will no more execute when you press the mouse button. The script is totally made using pynput library and is only for learning reasons, it don't have anything special in it.
